Project 2: ReadMe

This project focuses on local at global warming trends via found Data from various sources and sythesised Data. 
It contains plots, programmes and displays the data around global warming trends. 
The project is broke into a number of sections with each containing its own references where necessary. 
A bibliography containing all of the relevant references formatted in the Harvard referencing style is found at the end. 

Contents
1: Analysis of CO2 vs Temperature Anomaly from 800kyrs â€“ present
This section involves loading CO2 and temperature data and creating separate Excel files. Plots are generated to visualize the concentration of CO2 and temperature trends.

2: Examination of one other (paleo/modern) feature (CH4)
This explores methan (CH4) data from a specific dataset. The process of exporting the data to a CSV file for better readability are detailed. The methane data is then plotted to visualize its mean over time.

3: Examination of Irish context
The same code used in previous sections is applied to analyse the Irish context. A scatter plot with added grid lines is created to visualize yearly temperatures in Ireland.

4: Fusing and analysing of Data with it being exported to CSV and JSON formats
Data from various sources, including CO2, temperature, methane, and Irish data, are merged based on index. The merged dataset is then exported to both CSV and JSON formats statistics of the merged dataframe are provided.

5: Analysis of the data, the trends, and the relationships between them
Histograms and box plots are generated to analyse the distribution and concentration of CO2 and temperature. Lag analysis is performed using the shift function, and scatter plots with regression lines are created to visualize the relationships between variables.

6: Prediction global temperature anomaly over the next few decades using synthesized data
Linear regression is implemented to predict global temperature anomalies based on synthesized data. The data is split into training and testing sets, a linear regression model is created, and predictions are plotted against actual data. (incomplete due to time restraints).

7: Comments on accelerated warming based on very latest features
The section discusses the current state of global warming, with a focus on CO2 emissions in 2022 according to the IEA report. The impact of clean energy technologies, breakdown of emission sources, and regional variations are discussed. Insights from the Irish context are also provided.

Running the code
All codes are ran within the notebook itself.
